# To do

- [x] Change stimulus presentation to full screen (the current stimulus positions are likely fine). 

- [x] Alongside participant and session number, include boxes to record participant age and gender. 

- [x] Add instructions (a) at the beginning of the experiment/before practice trial block, and (b) before the beginning of the first 'real’ trial block. Spacebar to dismiss instructions.

(a) at the beginning of the experiment/before practice trial block
>
> Welcome to the experiment.
>
> The current task is comprised of a practice block, followed for four blocks of experimental trials. Each trial block consists of two phases: encoding and recall. 
>
> During the encoding phase you will be presented with two lists, each consisting of 10 target words (presented on the right of the screen) and 1 cue word (presented on the left of the screen). You will be presented with each list twice, once with target words presented sequentially, and once simultaneously. During the encoding phase you should try to remember as many target words as you can and may use whatever method you would like to do this.  
>
> The recall stage will then begin. At the start of the recall phase the cue word from list 1 will appear in the middle of the screen. When the cue word is shown you should recall as many of the list 1 target words as you can. You should recall each word verbally, into the microphone, and you should press the spacebar when you cannot remember any further words. On pressing the spacebar, the cue word from list 2 will appear in the middle of the screen and you should recall as many target words as you can from list 2. 
>
> Do you have any questions? 
>
> Please press the Spacebar to begin the practice trial block. 

(b) before the beginning of the first 'real’ trial block
>
> You have now finished the practice trial block. You will now encounter four experimental trial blocks that replicate the procedure you have just completed (i.e. in each block you will be asked to encode and verbally recall two word lists). You will be able to take a short break between each of the trial blocks.

>Do you have any questions?

> Please press the spacebar to begin block 1. 


- [x] During practice trials: (a) add the instruction to 'please encode each target word in List #’ when the first and second word list are presented. This instruction could be present when the participant encodes the lists in both presentation formats (i.e. sequential and simultaneous). This instruction could be added at the top of the screen, but I’m really not fussy, as long as the instructions are placed a sufficient distance away from the cue and target words. (b) add the instruction to 'please recall as many words as you can from word list # and press the (key) when you cannot remember any more’ during the two recall periods, ( c) prior to the presentation of each list for encoding would it be possible to add a filler screen that simply says 'List 1’ and 'List 2’ to differentiate between the two lists and to ensure that the participant notices the change in list/associated cue word. 

- [x] During experimental trials: By now the participant should understand the task so I don’t think it will be necessary to replicate steps (a) and (b) (i.e. including encoding and recall instructions), but would it still be possible to separate the two words lists during encoding with the filler screen (step c, above)?
